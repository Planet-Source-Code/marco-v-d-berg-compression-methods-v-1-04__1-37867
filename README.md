## \_\+Compression Methods\+\_ V 1\.04


</div>

### Description

I've got a lot of questions about if there was an update on packers collection, well, here it is. I have updated most of the compressors to handle filesizes over 64K. improved a lot lot of speed isseus. added some new compressors. great speed update on some coders (mostly BWT). I've got a uge amount of mail from people who liked the first version of my programm and also people who sended me some tips to speed up some methods. so I can't take all the credits for this update. I hope you all like this update as much as the first version and if you want to vote for it, please do so, couse with the first version something went wrong with the server and the actual winners of the coding contest didn't get the recognation they deserved.
